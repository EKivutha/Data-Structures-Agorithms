Informally, an algorithm is any well-deÔ¨Åned computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the
input into the output.

insertion sort, takes time roughly equal to c 1 n 2 to sort n items, where c 1
is a constant that does not depend on n. That is, it takes time roughly proportional
to n 2. Best for small input sizes.

merge sort, takes time roughly equal to c 2 n lg n, where lg n
stands for log 2 n and c 2 is another constant that also does not depend on n.Best for large input size due to the ln(x).
